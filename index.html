                    I am not a Rochester native, though I have lived in
                    Rochester since 1982. I was born in Athens, Greece and still
                    have family ties to that country. I came to Rochester when I
                    started my career at Kodak. I had finished at the University
                    of Aston, in the U.K., with a combined major in Chemistry
                    and Computer Science. After a long and varried carear I
                    decided to accept an offer to teach full time at NTID after
                    teaching two Semesters as an adjunct. It was a good
                    decision, though teaching up to 4 classes is very tiring.

                    I have a family -- a son and a daughter. My son work in the
                    BioInfomatics field, doing genonmic testing research and
                    development. He lives in New York City but works remotely
                    for a company in California (!) My daughter works at Strong
                    Hospital Cancer center as a Physician's Assistant. She is
                    busy at work and home with two crazy cats.

                    For fun ... I read some more over that which I do for
                    teaching. I like running, biking, swimming, home remodeling,
                    problem solving... I also teach Greek since I speak and
                    write it fluently - why not more teaching!
